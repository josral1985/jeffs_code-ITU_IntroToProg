# C# 

CSharp is a "Classical Object Oriented Programming Language"

- Classical here means "Class Based" (not like Mozart or something).

- Two kinds of things in .NET - Value Types and Reference Types


This means we build applications by thinking about *types*. We define types ad coding type by creating (mostly):
    - Classes - reference types
    - Structs - value types
    - Records - reference types
    - Struct Records - value types
