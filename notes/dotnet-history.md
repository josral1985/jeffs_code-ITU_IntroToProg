# .NET History Stuff

It is the late 90's - two big problems were happening for Microsoft.

1. Security "Virus Magnet" / Separation of Developer Division and OS Division
2. Java


## Parts of .NET

(you should learn these terms and acronyms)

1. CLR (Common Language Runtime)
    - .NET applications need a runtime. Not all programming languages do. 
2. CTS (Common Type System)
    - All .NET applications have two data types
        - Value Types
        - Reference Types
3. CIL - Common Intermediate Language 
        - Like Java ByteCode
        - What .NET applications compile "to"
        - Contained in an *Assembly*
            - An Assembly is a wad of compiled .NET code *and* Metadata about what types are in that assembly.
