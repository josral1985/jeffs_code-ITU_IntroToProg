# .NET

Created at Microsoft in the late '90's, a combination of a managed runtime, set of programming languages, and a base class library for building applications on the Windows operating system.

Some notable early inspirations in .NET:

- Security - Microsoft was getting beaten up for security at the time. .NET introduced "Code Access Security" on Windows, that was another layer on top of the "principle based security" of the Windows operating system.
- Multi-Language - Visual Basic .NET, C#, and the managed extensions for C++ initially, and vendors providing others.
- Managed Runtime - uses a garbage collection algorithm.
- ASP.NET WebForms - for building graphical user interfaces that run on the server side with client-side interactivity in the form of post-backs.
- ASP.NET Web Services - (ASMX) - A convenient way to create cross-platform APIs using SOAP based messaging, originally across HTTP.
some changes.
## Components

- CLR - The Common Language Runtime. The managed environment on which .NET code runs. Targeted originally only the Windows operating system.
- CTS - The Common Type System - defined two broad categories of interoperable types across all .NET-targeted programming languages. (Value types and Reference Types)
- FCL - The Framework Class Library - the "built in" types developers would use or extend to build their applications.
