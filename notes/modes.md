# Modes

Ask yourself, what am I doing right now?

## Application Development

Using technology in a particular way to solve a problem.
VERY specific. Most of the code you write should be directly related to a business problem, as opposed to a technical problem.

"Expressing Intent of the Business Rules through Code" 
Turns requirements into code. 

The code is to gain business advantage.

- Make us more money
- Limit Liability

Sometimes (OFTEN) speed is a huge part of the value.



## Library/Framework Development

More general than applications.

Best (and IMO should only) be created by extracting stuff from an application.



## Systems Programming

Writing operating systems, developer tools (build systems), data base engines, container runtimes.
