Suggestions/Comments
-	Practices to do outside of class
    - The practices I'm giving get the most value by repeating them.
    - I will provide some extra ones in these notes for you to do.
    - Write dumb stuff and throw it away.
-	Breakout Groups vs. Solo Work (prefer solo)
    - Please if you just want to do the practice solo, just mute the channel, and do your thing.
-	Love the groups (2)
-	How the Test Runner Works and Invokes the Code
-	More exception handling (banking solution)
-	How to learn large code bases
-	More OOP Principals
    - Today for sure - we are going to do inheritance, etc.
    - Then we'll get back (eventually) into our CSharpSyntax project and show some details.
-	First Day was a bit of a freakout
    - Yep. It was a little intended. ;) 
-	Wish the course was longer
    - This isn't the only course. 
-	Publishing Applications
    - I'll give you a link to the documentation on what I did.
    - We are going to emphasize "publishing" our applications (APIs) as Container Images.
-	Distributed Applications
    - We are going to do a bunch of this in coming days.
-	Testing in Containers, etc.
    - Container stuff coming up later
-	Test First vs. Test After
    - 
-	Project Types (when to choose what)
    - TODO: Get back to this.
-	If Else Statements – how to avoid
-	More testing – how much to test?
    - We are going to do a BIT of Integration Testing, and talk about different levels of testing.
    - The best answer to this question is really unsatisfying:
        - Test enough that you and your team have enough confidence in the quality of the code that you'd put it in production.
-	Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Internal, Protected, Protected Internal)
-	Are we expected to understand ALL of the code base?

Looking Forward To:
-	SQL/Database Stuff, 1,1
-	Angular 1,1,1,1,1,1,1
-	Containers 1,1,1
-	APIs
