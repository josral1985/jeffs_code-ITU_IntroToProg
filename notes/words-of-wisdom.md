# Words of Wisdom

## You Mostly Cannot Write Good Code and A Good Program at the Same Time - Don't Try.

You have a finite brain. We all do. Some are bigger than others. The trick is to make it work FIRST, before you worry about "good".

Don't make up crap. Don't add requirements.

Don't get fancy. Don't worry about "what if X sees my code?"

Don't even worry about great names for stuff yet.

Just come up with the simplest thing that can work. ("Passes the tests").

And here is how you become a great programmer: DO NOT CHECK THAT CRAP IN. You are NOT done.

After it works, make it "more better". Clean it up, refactor, change names, etc.

### Worry about:
- "Expresses Intent" - could others understand my code and the intention behind it?
- "Remove Duplication" - maybe you copied and pasted stuff. Fine. Maybe there is subtle duplication (algorithms, etc). Can you clean that up?
- "Fewest Elements" - could I make this simpler? Less moving pieces?
    - Bugs live in decisions (`if` statements) and loops. Can you do with less?
    - Less variables means less bugs.

### Code is a "living" thing - it will grow and change over time.

- Requirements will change
- Defects will be found
- New language features added
- You get smarter

Software is a *process* more than a *project*.
